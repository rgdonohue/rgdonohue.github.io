        <h2>Harnessing the power of the Open Web Platform for mapping</h2>
        <p>Q: What is the modern web mapping workflow and what skills and processes are needed to make a web map?</p>
        <p>A: The current web mapping workflow consists of a range of technologies, skills, and conceptual knowledge, as well as a process for their implementation to achieve a desired result. The range and sequence of the web development workflow is in part captured by the notion of the full stack, which refers to the suite of technologies and required skill sets needed to successfully transform data into a deployable product on the web.</p>
        <div id='map'></div>
        <p class="columns">This stack is often conceived as a continuum from “back end” server-side technologies to “front end” client-side technologies through to the design of user experience (UX) itself. The term full stack is often used to refer to the occupations or people who possess the skills and expertise that span the entire workflow as well, as in a “full stack developer.” While the web mapping workflow introduces new objectives and knowledge into the scope, the full stack is useful way of articulating the workflow process. The full stack maps nicely to a web-mapping workflow, particularly in terms of determining various roles that suite individual strengths and preferences.</p>

        <h2>teaching philosophy</h2>

        <p>My work as an academic scholar is strongly committed to excellence in teaching and education. Both my Masters degree in Education and my dissertation research—the latter of which focused upon pedagogy and curricular improvement of digital Cartography courses—strongly contributed to a teaching philosophy that guides my practice within the classroom. This philosophy can be simplified to one simple goal: that of empowering student learning.</p>
        <img src="images/dots_grat_640.png" alt="map made in CartoDB">
        <p class='columns'>I employ a variety of teaching strategies to achieve the goal of empowerment that are grounded in three principles. First, a <strong>principle of instant feedback</strong> guides how I design instructional aids as well as my responsiveness with students. Geospatial technologies in particular are difficult to teach well due to the magnitude of related concepts and skills. The use of web-based live code editors and short, scripted examples in which students can immediately see the rendered outcome of their work is essential for solidifying conceptual knowledge and motivating students to keep learning. While instructing the laboratory sections of <i>Graphic Design in Cartography</i> and <i>Interactive Cartography &amp; Geovisualization</i> at UW-Madison, I persistently revised tutorials and lab examples—as well as their mode of presentation and the technologies employed—to promote this principle of immediate feedback. I strongly believe that these techniques are useful for demonstrating cartographic concepts within within lecture as well. Rather than merely showing existing examples of appropriate bivariate thematic symbology or the application of Bertin’s visual variables to a given geographic phenomenon, for example, small prototypical examples of these concepts can be adjusted in real time for demonstration purposes and later experimented and modified by students to suit a given task requirement. This is but one example of how lecture material can be more effectively integrated with laboratory work. Finally, a rapid reply to an email or quick return of assessment on assignments are also examples of instant feedback I prioritize that makes students feel valued and again maintains their interest in the material.</p>
        <p>A second principle informing my teaching is that of maximal challenge. Students learn best when they are pushed just to the point of being overwhelmed. While it is crucial to provide appropriate scaffolding to meet learning objectives, as well as limit the array of new concepts introduced at any one time, the highest learning gains are achieved when students struggle to understand a new idea or concept. I push student toward maximal challenge through careful attention to the scope (i.e., the depth of knowledge about a given subject) and sequence (i.e., the order in which new concepts are introduced) of GIScience and Cartography-related material. For example, when teaching students the basics of web map interface development, I first introduce a few of the required competencies that govern the structural (i.e., HTML/SVG), stylistic (i.e., CSS) and behavioral (i.e., JavaScript) elements of an interactive information graphic. I then push students to understand how they work in concert to produce the desired outcome. A second pass through the sequence then propels students to think more deeply through the scope of new concepts. While a third pass then challenges students to connect these visual elements with a cartographic solution that meets an end user’s interface objective. Teaching to the maximal challenge, however, requires vigil attention to students’ frustrations and motivation levels, and the ability to adapt the instruction when needed. Through employment of such teaching strategies, students under my instruction have been highly successful in national student mapping competitions, including three first-prize winners of the annual NACIS student mapping competition and one first-place prize for the National Geographic student mapping competition. Students under my mentorship have also been awarded the Code for America fellowship and gained internships working for USAID and National Geographic.</p>
        <p class='columns'>A third principle that ensures success in the classroom is ownership over the experience. Two elements that impede effective learning are misconceptions (i.e., beliefs that students bring with them into the classroom that lead to incorrect or counterintuitive understandings) and threshold concepts which act as conceptual gateways to either hinder or enable “aha” moments that integrate existing knowledge with new understanding. My teaching prioritizes active student learning to promote critical reflection of assumed knowledge (to counter misconceptions) and effectively overcome a steep, often technically challenging, learning curve. Promoting such ownership involves leveling hierarchies between myself and students to think through problems together, side by side, and posing key questions at key times. Admittedly, this level of dedication subsumes a great deal of time when done one-on-one, so I promote greater collaboration between advanced and less experienced students to help augment such explanation. Collaborative learning among students additionally helps expose misconceptions. For example, when thinking through a problem such as how to integrate the Python and GDAL environments for more efficient raster manipulation, one student may notice another has not properly set environmental paths in the proper sequence, and she can quickly point this out. These seemingly trivial blockages can substantially stymie a students progress through an exercise. The crucial pedagogical technique for enabling ownership over threshold concepts is providing many small examples that build upon and relate to one another, yet require students make the final step or draw the connections themselves. When lecturing UW-Madison’s Geocomputing course, for example, I realized that merely demonstrating concepts such as how Python reads binary files such as the shapefile (.shx) index file was drastically improved when providing students with pseudo-code and offering smaller example scripts that independently performed such tasks retrieving the number of polygons from the index file. Therein lies the path to the “aha” moment that empowers student learning and crystallizes their understanding of complex geospatial concepts and skills. I was also fortunate to assist the instructor in our Undergraduate Research Colloquium in which students were given ownership over their learning while conducting a primary-evidence based research project. One student I guided through this process and wrote a letter of reference for was later admitted for a Masters program at Columbia University.</p>
        <p class='columns'>The Carl O. Sauer Professor Emeritus Bill Denevan inspired me when he gave a lecture for UW-Madison’s Yi-Fu Tuan Lecture Series in which he spoke of a productive and dialectical relationship between teaching and research throughout his career. Today I find myself extremely fortunate to have mapped out a similar path forward through my own career. For me, the practice of doing cartography is entwined with both teaching map making within the classroom and a research agenda which shifts the “user” in user-centered design to that of the mapmaker, in this case, the student. I do not haphazardly apply inherited teaching material to a learning environment, nor do I allow apathy or work overload hamper my commitment to excellence in teaching. Rather, I leverage the principles of instant feedback, maximal challenge, and ownership over experience to produce the most effective student learning environments possible.</p>

        <h2>where have i been?</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>My research investigates the technical transition within Web Cartography to modern web design standards, collectively known as the Open Web Platform. I explore the ways in which maps are designed, developed, and used online.</p>
        <p>Technological changes in the late 2000s affected how cartographers design and disseminate high-quality, interactive geospatial infographics on the web and forced to educators reexamine how to effectively teach students the skills and concepts knowledge needed to build effective cartographic interfaces within the new medium. To this end, my dissertation (2014) sought to answer 4 research questions:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>What technologies currently are available for web mapping and how do they vary?</li>
        <li>What are the important characteristics of web maps that should inform the selection of geospatial technologies?</li>
        <li>How should web mapping be taught in higher education?</li>
        <li>How can we better cope with the continued changes in web mapping and geospatial technologies?</li>
        </ol>
        <p> My research stablish a web mapping workflow comprising a data->representation->interaction sequence for design and development processes. Feel free to read my dissertation on <a href="docs/donohue_2014_web_cartography_with-web_standards.pdf">Web Cartography with Web Standards</a>.</p>
        <h2>where am i now?</h2>
        <p>My current research at the University of Kentucky directly applies my dissertation research to curriculum development of an online mapping Certificate and Masters of Science program. This opportunity allows me to further develop the pedagogical bridgework between technical aspects of web mapping and conceptual knowledge of GIScience and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) that inform Web Cartography. Additionally it affords a practical and scholarly shift in thinking from teaching cartography within the classroom to online learning environments, seeking to address the following two questions:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>How do we replicate within the web medium the important hands-on teaching and face-to-face collaborative work that occurs within a live classroom?</li>
        <li>Who is the target student for new mappings today, and what technical literacies do we expect them to master?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Research aiming to answer these questions is investigating the purchase of emerging web-based tools for collaborative learning as ways to replace the face-to-face interactions in the classroom, as well as address the range of motivations and background experience that challenges education involving geospatial technologies.</p>
        <p class="columns">My postdoctoral fellowship also provides the opportunity to engage with the professors and graduate students at the University of Kentucky who research big data and visualization techniques for exploring large and complex data sets. I am working to improve the analysis of the information through applying better cartographic interface and geovisualization solutions such as filtering, live-brushing, and coordinated visualization. The goal is to improve how we visually think through the data to gain insight into more conventional geographic problems from which these social media occur.</p>
        <h2>where am I going?</h2>
        <p>My ongoing research is currently formalized around two principal areas.</p>
        <p><strong>One</strong>, the continual shifting of geospatial technologies and the web requires sustained research into both translating established best practices to new technical modes and discovering new geovisualization techniques enabled by these technologies. I am particularlu interested in adaptive cartography and how web maps respond to particular user devices, locations, and profiles to serve customized cartographic displays to support specific user needs.</p>
        <p><strong>Two</strong>, I explore how cartographic design and geovisualization techniques are applied to both domain-specific research and analysis of large and complex data. Beyond merely measuring the effectiveness and usability of interface solutions, I explore a tension in Web Cartography between the more general and the more domain-specific applications of cartographic processes and principles. In other words, beyond simply looking for ways to apply complex algorithms to complex datasets, what is the role of the cartographer in harnessing new geospatial technologies to explore the cultural, social, and political geographies through data?</p>
        <h2>depricated research</h2>
        <p class='columns'>I spent a few years engaged with a research project investigating the implications of placing arrays of large wind turbines on our landscapes to help solve our renewable energy needs.  While I retreated from this project for completion of my PhD in Geography (in favor of Cartography), I'm still deeply committed to understanding how we produce our power and the role energy plays in our lives.</p>

        <h2>situated laboratories?</h2>
        <p>The name "situated laboratories" originated from the writings of Science and Technology scholars Bruno Latour, John Law, and Donna Haraway.  For many years it probably smacked of obscure, elitist intellectualism (which it may have been).</p>
        <p>Given my recent training in spatial science &ndash; <em>situated?</em> &ndash; and desire for a playful, experimental engagement with the web &ndash; <em>laboratory?</em> &ndash; perhaps it's coming to make sense.</p>
